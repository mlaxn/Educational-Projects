Tutorial about text-classification analysis in python
===========================================

In this tutorial I use python and the libraries
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* nltk

to show you how to do proper text classification

I needed to compress the data-file since it was to big to upload it to github.
Please unpack the file into the data folder to get the script working without any changes.
