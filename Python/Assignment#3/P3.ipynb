Each prominent streak should be displayed in the format of (player ID, beginning index of the streak, length of the streak, minimum value in the streak). The beginning index provides the position of the left end of the streak. In a player's seequence, the index of the first element is 0. \n",

When we test your code on the same computer, your code is expected to achieve the same efficiency, in order to be considered efficiently implemented. Note that an implementation of the brute-force baseline method took several mminutes to finish."
